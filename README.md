## Running the tests

Make sure you have [.NET 6.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) installed.

Then, from your terminal, go to `Engi.Substrate.Tests` and run:

```
dotnet test
```

If you want to mess around with the code, you can keep the tests running on every change with:

```
dotnet watch test
```
